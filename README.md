Teaching is one of the best ways to learn new things. I have been teaching as an instructor at the National Institute of Physics, University of the Philippines Diliman for two years now. 

_Courses taught:_
* Physics 71: **Elementary Physics I** (_Newtonian mechanics, fluid mechanics, and waves)
* Physics 72: **Elementary Physics II** (_Electric charge, field, & potential, circuits, electromagnetic waves, optics)
* Physics 72.1: **Elementary Physics II Laboratory**
* Physics 107.1: **Fundamental Physics II Laboratory**
* Applied Physics 181 and 182: **Physical Electronics I and II**

_Student evaluation:_
* After every semester, students evaluate our performance as their class instructor via the Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) module. On a 1.00 (highest) - 5.00 (lowest, failing) scale, the highest evaluation that I obtained was 1.24; and, the lowest score that I obtained was 1.72, with an average score of 1.5.
